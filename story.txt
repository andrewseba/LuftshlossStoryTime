Once upon a time, Dr. Mehlhase was walking her hund around Tempe. 
When suddenly, a Porshe sped by and skinnned her knees.
The Hauptrasse was full of traffic so I stayed home where there is Klimaanlage.
She really enjoyed wettbewerbsfaehig sports on television.
Watching sports on on TV means she gets to enjoy klimaanlage. 
But suddenly a team from Berlin started competing and she tossed her apfelkuchen out of her lap by accident when cheering them on.
I was driving my BMW to the Biergarten to meet some friends.
